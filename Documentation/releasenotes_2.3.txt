RELEASENOTES SQLCOMPONENTS VERSION 2.3
======================================
===== Released since: 06-09-2023 =====
======================================

Version 2.3.5 of 08-12-2025
---------------------------
1)  Ported to Visual Studio 2026
2)  Read-only mode:
    The SQLDatabasePool now has a 'm_readOnly' member to open all databases in the
    read-only mode. This is convenient for turning the complete application and all
    of its database connections in the read-only state.
    Transactions on a read-only state SQLDatabase connection now always rollback 
    the complete connection, even if the program's logic dictates a commit.
    The SQLDatabase transaction logic has been fully refurbished and checked
    Read-only connections will no longer rollback to savepoint, as this leads to 
    errors on all databases, and there is no point in rolling back only to savepoint.

Version 2.3.4 of 15-10-2025
---------------------------
1)  Fixes for MySQL and a Northwind test database for MySQL
2)  Synchronisation with the latest BaseLibrary and XPath upgrade
3)  MariaDB is now derived from MySQL as it is 95% identical
    MySQL does not support SEQUENCES
4)  Parameters for the SQLQuery now support input/output types. The result is that
    more database types can be supported for output parameters.
    Please review the "SetParameter" / "GetParameter" methods for extra optional 
    parameters.
    Rewriting your logic especially for "GetParameter" migth be in order.
    Also see the changes in the Unit testset for this change!!

Version 2.3.3 of 27-07-2025
---------------------------
1)  Various fixes for streaming of data with SQLPutData and SQLGetData for (C/B)LOB's
    and the various LONGxxxxx data types, for SQLServer and Oracle
2)  Empty interval should yiels a zero duration, instead of an empty string
3)  SQLXport Unicode fixes
4)  Full roundtrip export/import with SQLXport program. Tested with the 'Northwind'
    database for the following RDBMses:
    -  Firebird
    -  MariaDB (MySQL)
    -  PostgreSQL
    -  Oracle
    -  SQLServer
5)  Full support for case-sensitive database objects. Most ODBC drivers only support
    case-sensitive discovery for SQLTables and SQLColumns. Other discovery functions
    mostly fail (SQLPrimaryKeys, SQLForeignKes, SQLStatistics, SQLProcedures etc)

Version 2.3.2 of 17-02-2025
---------------------------
1)  SQLVariant::GetAsChar() now no longer returns a XString, but a char*
    in order to return correct string literals from the ODBC driver
    It's meant to be ONLY for ANSI builds, as it will not work in UNICODE builds
    All instances of "GetAsChar()" in this library has been replaced with
    calls to 'GetAsString()'
2)  Fix for SQLVariantFormat::StringDecimalValue in case a string does not
    contain a number and cannot be converted to a bcd number

Version 2.3.1 of 18-01-2024
---------------------------
1)  You can now use named parameters in the call to SQLQuery.DoODBCCall
    to call a stored procedure or function.
    This works at least in the Oracle and SQL-Server RDBMS'es
    For an example see the unittest in "TestCalling::TestNamedParameters"
    Even return values from a stored procedure are possible.
2)  Added the possiblity to get a 'SELECT FOR UPDATE' lock on a record
    For correct use: there are two extra SQLInfoDB methods:
    - GetSelectForUpdateTableClause(unsigned p_lockWaitTime) const;
    - GetSelectForUpdateTrailer(XString p_select,unsigned p_lockWaitTime) const;
    These are used in the 'Open' method of the SQLDataSet.
    When generating your own SQL: Refer to te uses of these
    The first is used for an extra clause in the 'FROM <table>' part
    The second is used on the total sql string!
3)  The method "SQLInterval::AsDatabaseDouble()" (returning double) has been replaced
    by a new method "SQLInterval::AsDatabaseNumber()" which now in its turn returns
    a 'bcd' number. Please adjust your application accordingly
4)  In the "SQLInterval" class the method 'double AsDatabaseDouble()' 
    is replaced by 'bcd AsDatabaseNumber()'
5)  In the "VariantFormat" class a number of methods have changed and added. These are:
    - 'SetCurrentDate has been renamed to 'SetCurrentDateAndTime'
    - 'StrValutaNLOmzetten' has been renamed to 'RemoveValutaEuro'
    - 'StrValutaAMOmzetten' has been renamed to 'RemoveValutaDollar'
    - 'double StringDoubleValue' has been changed to 'bcd StringDecimalValue'
    - There is a new method to format the variant as an interval constant named
      'XString FormatVariantAsInterval(SQLDatabase*)'

Version 2.3.0 of 06-09-2023
---------------------------
1)  Library is now fully Unicode compliant
2)  Can be compiled in MBCS or in Unicode text mode
    Beware that you write all of your string literals with the _T("") macro
    Beware that you use the "_t" variants of the C standard library functions
    so use e.g. "_ttoi(i)" instead of "atoi(i)"
3)  Most uses of "const char*" are now mitigated to LPCTSTR
    Most uses of "char" are mitigated to TCHAR
    Most uses of "unsigned char" are mitigated to _TUCHAR
    BUT NOT ALL: Be aware of various buffers in this library!
3)  The SQLVariant type has been extended with the "SQL_C_WCHAR" type
    And various constructors and SetParameter methods have been extended
    with the "bool p_wide = false" parameter to give you the ability to write
    code to enter / bind a XString with a Unicode string to a database column
4)  The BasicExcel and BasicXmlExcel classes have been expanded to be able to
    handle spreadsheet files in Unicode compilation mode.
    Internal XML sheets are converted from UTF-8 to internal strings before handling
5)  Handle the "SQLQuery.SetParameter" calls in your code with care!
    For the XString and LPCTSTR variants, the extra 'p_wide' parameter comes BEFORE
    the optional parameter for the type.
