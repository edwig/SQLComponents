Version 2.0.2 of 25-04-2022
---------------------------
1)  When creating an SQLTimestamp from a scanned string, this class wil now recognize 
    a string with an UTC time ending in 'Z'. Correcting the time from UTC to the current
    local time.
2)  AutoDBS has an extra option to pass on an already existing SQLDatabase connection,
    or requesting a new one from the database pool.

Version 2.0.1 of 29-03-2022
---------------------------
1)  Fixed an ISO8601 bug in SQLTimestamp::AsString<XXX> methods.
2)  Fixed timestamp string scanning of the fractional part. Timestamp from strings with a 
    fractional part now get correctly converted to a SQLTimestamp again.
3)  Extended SQLRecord to accomodate CXHibernate (https://github.com/edwig/cxhibernate)
4)  Fixes for BaseLibrary (https://github.com/edwig/baselibrary)

Version 2.0.0 of 20-03-2022
---------------------------
1)  Now inlcuded the "BaseLibrary" (https://github.com/edwig/BaseLibrary) into the
    SQLComponents library. This moves out all the duplicated classes like XMLMessage
    and all other dependencies. So that the need not resynced over-and-over.
2)  All projects in the Visual Studio solution explorer now have a 'Configuraiton' filter
    containing the windows-sdk-version and MFC inclusions.
3)  All use of CString has been converted to XString
4)  These actions clear the way to be using SQLComponents in the future free of MFC in
    server-only environments where COW (Copy-On-Write) behaviour of CStrings is in the way
    of clear multi-threaded program use and performance.
