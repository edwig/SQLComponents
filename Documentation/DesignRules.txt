DESIGN RULES FOR SQLCOMPONENTS
==============================

1) All components are within the "SQLComponents" namespace.
2) All throws are of type "StdException". So calling programs **MUST**
   rely on a try...catch cycle that catches "StdException" objects
3) Everything must work in both 32-bits and 64-bits modes
4) Platform of choice is MSVC 2022, C++17.0 standard
5) Coding-guidelines are:
   - 1 tab = 2 spaces
   - Hungarian camelcase naming rules
   - class members have the "m_" prefix
   - method parameters have the "p_" prefix
6) All ODBC driver datatypes are covered by SQLVariant natively
7) All ODBC binary data is covered by m_data of SQLVariant
8) All functionality must be covered by C++ unit tests
   (More than 8800 and counting...)
