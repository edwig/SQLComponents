RELEASENOTES SQLCOMPONENTS VERSION 2.2
======================================
===== Released since: 19-03-2023 =====
======================================

Version 2.2.0 of 19-03-2023
---------------------------
1)  SQLMigrate has been dropped from the library in favor of the
    Open-ODBCQuerytool project. This program is now maintained under
    that project, so to be able to deploy it more easily to customers
    and to let it take advantage of the StyleFramework.
2)  ReWrite of the bcd code. It now has a silent failure mode to support
    IEEE-745 INF (infinity), -INF (negative inifinity) and NaN 
    (Not a Number) statusses as well as the database NULL status
3)  ReWrite of the bcd code. It no longer needs the precision and scale
    These will be calculated automatically when converting a bcd to a 
    database SQL_NUMERCIC_STRUCT.
4)  Updated to the last version of the BaseLibrary (1.0.9)
