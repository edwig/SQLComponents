RELEASENOTES SQLCOMPONENTS VERSION 3.0
======================================
===== Released since: 15-10-2025 =====
======================================

CAVEAT: Work on the 3.0.0 has begun in the master branch
        THIS IS BY NOW MEANS A WORKING BRANCH
        For production code: use the "version2" branch of this library!!!

Version 3.0.0 of xx-xx-2025
---------------------------
1)  Now based on version 2.0.0 of the BaseLibrary dropping the dependency on MFC
    ATL::CString is now fully replaced by std::string and std::wstring
2)  Converted to Visual Studio 2026
3)  Dropped support for 32-bits builds.
4)  Read-only mode:
    The SQLDatabasePool now has a 'm_readOnly' member to open all databases in the
    read-only mode. This is convenient for turning the complete application and all
    of its database connections in the read-only state.
    Transactions on a read-only state SQLDatabase connection now always rollback 
    the complete connection, even if the program's logic dictates a commit.
    The SQLDatabase transaction logic has been fully refurbished and checked
    Read-only connections will no longer rollback to savepoint, as this leads to 
    errors on all databases, and there is no point in rolling back only to savepoint.
5)  Added the "IsFixedLengthType()" to the SQLVariant. This simplies the 
    SQLQuery procedure of getting long data from the ODBC driver.
6)  Various small fixes for the database discovery classes.
