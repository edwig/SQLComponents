======================================

Version 2.1.0 of 14-01-2023
---------------------------
1)  Complete re-write of the parameter and column bindings of SQLQuery.
    For this important part of the library, this is a serious change.
    Extended testing on MS-SQLServer with data pumping has led to this rewrite.
2)  ParameterBinding for a query can be corrected throug the SQLInfoDB classes
3)  ColumnBinding and AtExec data provision has been rewritten for the rule
    that no columns may be bound after the first at-exec data column.
    So data is fetched by the SQLFetch up to the first at-exec column.
    All other columns including the 'normal' columns will be fetched with the 
    SQLGetData calls.
4)  The indicator length binding with SQL_LEN_DATA_AT_EXEC is now limited to the
    binary datatypes only. All character types are changed to NTS (char,varchar)
    and DATA_AT_EXEC for the wide character types (WCHAR, WVARCHAR).
5)  The subclass SQLDBinfoSQLServer has been extended with various discovery 
    queries to support database export and import functions.
6)  Various smal fixesd in DDLCreateTable class to generate DDL for a table.
7)  Maximum timeout for the SQLDatabasePool is now 'settable' in SQLDatabase.
