======================================

Version 1.7.0 of 16-08-2020
---------------------------
1) Added a SQL Migration wizard to migrate the database contents from a source database
   to a target database of a different brand. Currently supported databases are:
   MS-Access, Firebird, Informix, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MS-SQLServer
   From these databases the following are migrated
   - Tables and columns including datatypes
   - Primary keys
   - Indices
   - Foreign keys
   - Sequences (if applicable)
   - Views
   - Access rights
   If the migration goes between databases of the same brand, also table triggers are supported

   PLEASE BE ADVISED:
   Although the program has been in-use for more than 15 years, no conversion or migration 
   that we have seen was without program changes. It stays a work-in-progress. Expect to do
   some programming to get a near-perfect result.

2) Lots of extra methods have been added to the SQLInfoDB derived classes.
3) SQLQuery has been expanded to support better data pumping from one database to another.
4) The DDLCreateTable class is now used in the SQLMigrate program. It has been largely enhanced.
